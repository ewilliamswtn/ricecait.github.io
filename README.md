Caitlin Rice Website

### Latest changes: 
Homepage banner changed. Removed gradient, changed background, added (placeholder) profile picture in foreground. "Contact" nav bar button scrolls to bottom of whatever page user is currently on.

CV added on CV page, uploaded as a pdf and imbedded inside an iframe. Pdf currently hosted on  my google drive.

Also, I just picked the picture as a placeholder, so if there's one you'd like me to use, please let me know. I can also touch pictures up, or cut out around your face (like I did for the one currently used as the placeholder), just let me know what, if any, you'd like done. Also please note where and how you would like the picture displayed.

#### Happy to start polishing up, or tweak whats there, or completely overhaul, or go any direction you'd like. Just let me know! 

This hasn't been completely formatted for mobile yet either, so I'll fix that as we move forward.

## here's some text for the homepage:

Right now I'm a PhD candidate in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience in the [Learning Research and Development Center](https://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh.  I work with Natasha Tokowicz in the [PLUM Lab](http://plumlab.pitt.edu/) where we study memory, learning, and language acquisition and processing using behavioral, computational, and electrophysiological (EEG/ERP) methodologies. I'm a member of the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I also collaborate with [Blair Armstrong](http://www.blairarmstrong.net/) at the University of Toronto and [Scott Fraundorf](http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/maplelab/) at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Previously I was an undergraduate at Grinnell College in [Janet Gibson's]() lab. I also worked as a Research Associate for Susan Nittrouer's [Speech Development Lab](http://www.speechdevelopment.org/) as well as for the [Center for Innovation in Pediatric Practice](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/research/areas-of-research/center-for-innovation-in-pediatric-practice) at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

hey caitlin

## here's some text for the homepage:

Right now I'm a PhD candidate in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience in the [Learning Research and Development Center](https://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh.  I work with Natasha Tokowicz in the [PLUM Lab](http://plumlab.pitt.edu/) where we study memory, learning, and language acquisition and processing using behavioral, computational, and electrophysiological (EEG/ERP) methodologies. I'm a member of the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I also collaborate with [Blair Armstrong](http://www.blairarmstrong.net/) at the University of Toronto and [Scott Fraundorf](http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/maplelab/) at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Previously I was an undergraduate at Grinnell College in [Janet Gibson's]() lab. I also worked as a Research Associate for Susan Nittrouer's [Speech Development Lab](http://www.speechdevelopment.org/) as well as for the [Center for Innovation in Pediatric Practice](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/research/areas-of-research/center-for-innovation-in-pediatric-practice) at Nationwide Children's Hospital.
